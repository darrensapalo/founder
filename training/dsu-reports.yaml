    remarks: |
      I ought to be more careful about how I spend my time. I'm worried that I 
      might end up trying to do too many broad things that don't create value for
      Tome.gg.
    done_yesterday: |
      - I started with working on the Librarian protocol, such that I am now able
        to parse the YAML files.
      - I started work on the Librarian protocol's validation rules for the DSU
        validations.
      - I started on my automated-marketing tool. It leverages
        GitHub webhooks triggered by commits, n8n for automation, OpenAI for Tweet
        generation, and social integrations (Twitter, Discord) for distribution.
      - I also

      - I resumed my work on the validators, finished the DSU validator, and 
        started with the evaluator validator. This one will be responsible for
        validating the evaluations of a mentor/teacher/evaluator.
      - I reviewed why the automated-marketing tool wasn't posting Tweets. It had
        permission issues, so I configured it so that it will post on the Tome.gg
        Twitter account. I was able to verify that it works.
      - I also explored building a dynamically-generated daily progress banner for
        people learning in public. This automatically lifts data from your Tome.gg
        DSU repository, similar to this one.
      - I also built out a fish tool to easily add entries to the DSU.
      - I also built made pre-built binaries for the `tome` CLI, and an intake 
        page for alpha testers for Tome.gg, so that it will be easy to invite
        developers to try out the tooling.

    done_yesterday: |
      - I finished creating the librarian protocol, the librarian CLI, and a sample repository (this one). 
      - I also finished creating an in-take form for interested apprentices who wish to learn in public.
    doing_today: |
      - I'm going to be taking it easy today and focus on reading items. 
      - It will be a study day rather than a build day. 
      - I'll review my Click Up board for reading material, organize which content should be prioritized. 
      - Today I will focus on resisting the urge to keep building, and stepping back to see the bigger picture. 
      - I will have a more organized click up board and a clear picture of which tasks have more weight in 
        bringing value to Tome.gg and its beneficiaries.

      - I'll be busy driving today, so work will be intermittent. 
      - As I will be out, I worry about my internet connectivity. If internet fails, I'll focus on reading 
        some books that I have on my kindle. I should also set up reading materials (from ClickUp) into my 
        kindle in case this connectivity issue happens again.
