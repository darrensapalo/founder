      These were planning information that I came up with, in preparation for 
      the Solana Grizzlython 2023 Hackathon. They were written in my bear notes 
      app before they were transferred into the repository.
    doing_today: |
      - I studied more about the revenue streams and business planning for Tome.gg
        and identified its key novelty concept. These were included into the Solana
        Grizzlython 2023 hackathon pitch deck presentation.
    done_yesterday: |
      - I focused on building a prototype of the Tome.gg Alignment Negotiation 
        smart contract. It's a very basic model for negotiation.
      - Question: is there a way to verify that a single file in Git is only written
        or modified by a single contributor? If so, then that is a good way to 
        verify that the evaluations are not modified in any way.

      The following notes were copied from my Bear note app (offline note taking)
      which I spoke about/planned while I was driving. This is why the date of 
      entry into the repository (March 22) doesn't match the datetime submitted.

      - no information
    doing_today: |
      - we can skip all over the alignment negotiation protocol first and focus on
        the protocol design for storing the data for your daily standup report and
        your growth data.
      - Let's try to look at it from an evaluation first perspective. Evaluation 
        can be done at a per instance style, where in each day is evaluated each 
        day. The other option is evaluating a series of the data as a whole set 
        for example, evaluating five days altogether that flexibility should allow 
        us to analyze the data individually or in a aggregate. This makes it 
        flexible for people who don't want to analyze each data point. 
      - From a mentor's perspective this is convenient because that might be less 
        work for me and we're going to be able to look at or evaluate the different
        dimensions. For example- focus, consistency, clarity … across multiple data
        points so at least the student has some opportunity to practice the skill
        consistently over a period of time. Each evaluation can then demonstrate 
        whether they have been consistently able to perform based on those 
        aggregate evaluation. 
      - Now, let's analyze it from a solo player perspective when I don't have a
        mentor of my own- how do I keep myself accountable to myself into my 
        objectives? This means that I need to mentor myself, in which case I 
        specify very clearly my objectives and my goals, specify specific objectives,
        actionable things that can be measured and tracked and see whether or not 
        they do that.
      - From a solo player perspective… what is important to me for evaluation of 
        my growth at the end of my evaluation? I want to be able to see whether or
        not I have actually been practicing the skills (consistency, focus, clarity)
        and see whether I am progressing from my Likert scale of 1 to 5. 
      - This is going to demonstrate self evaluation, and I can double check with
        my mentors in DLSU, whether or not the efforts that I am doing does indeed
        contribute to what I am trying to accomplish. It is going to be attractive
        for mentors because they're going to be able to see an individual really 
        practicing consistency.
      - We're not going to be creating a view for the mentor specifically. For now
        we're just going to be leveraging markdown and Github. That's where they 
        can view my growth in my development.
      - A common pitfall is trying to aim for usability and correctness of the start.
        No, we are going to be focusing first on making things work, so we'll start 
        with some simple protocol definition and give it a version.

      I ought to be more careful about how I spend my time. I'm worried that I 
      might end up trying to do too many broad things that don't create value for
      Tome.gg.
    done_yesterday: |
      - I started with working on the Librarian protocol, such that I am now able
        to parse the YAML files.
      - I started work on the Librarian protocol's validation rules for the DSU
        validations.
      - I started on my automated-marketing tool. It leverages
        GitHub webhooks triggered by commits, n8n for automation, OpenAI for Tweet
        generation, and social integrations (Twitter, Discord) for distribution.
      - I also 
    doing_today: |
      - I resumed my work on the validators, finished the DSU validator, and 
        started with the evaluator validator. This one will be responsible for
        validating the evaluations of a mentor/teacher/evaluator.
      - I reviewed why the automated-marketing tool wasn't posting Tweets. It had
        permission issues, so I configured it so that it will post on the Tome.gg
        Twitter account. I was able to verify that it works.
      - I also explored building a dynamically-generated daily progress banner for
        people learning in public. This automatically lifts data from your Tome.gg
        DSU repository, similar to this one.
      - I also built out a fish tool to easily add entries to the DSU.
      - I also built made pre-built binaries for the `tome` CLI, and an intake 
        page for alpha testers for Tome.gg, so that it will be easy to invite
        developers to try out the tooling.

      - I finished creating the librarian protocol, the librarian CLI, and a 
        sample repository (this one). 
      - I also finished creating an in-take form for interested apprentices who 
        wish to learn in public.
    doing_today: |
      - I'm going to be taking it easy today and focus on reading items. 
      - It will be a study day rather than a build day. 
      - I'll review my Click Up board for reading material, organize which 
        content should be prioritized. 
      - Today I will focus on resisting the urge to keep building, and stepping 
        back to see the bigger picture. 
      - I will have a more organized click up board and a clear picture of which
        tasks have more weight in bringing value to Tome.gg and its beneficiaries.
    blockers: |-
      - I'll be busy driving today, so work will be intermittent. 
      - As I will be out, I worry about my internet connectivity. If internet 
        fails, I'll focus on reading some books that I have on my kindle. I 
        should also set up reading materials (from ClickUp) into my kindle 
        in case this connectivity issue happens again.
    remarks: |
      - Interestingly, when a person does not have internet access, they can still
        write their DSU reports offline, timestamp the work, and push it out later.
      - Of course this can be forged (by changing local time on your host machine)
        but it has somewhat an interesting offline/async property in your daily
        reporting.

      - I was able to read a few things about Tome.gg when I arrived back at home.
      - I did get to practice resisting my urges to dream of and to build little 
        small projects around Tome.gg. 
      - During my drive, I was able to think about Tome.gg more in marketing terms,
        and kept my notes in my Bear app.
      - I did not get to organize my ClickUp board because our internet has been 
        intermittent.
      - I did study more about what kinds of partners I can work with (university
        orgs and such).
    doing_today: |
      - We're going to read some books (The Status Game, some articles), and write
        down notes on Bear app re: how some principles can be applied to Tome.gg.
      - We're going to also open up the Whitepaper so we can resume writing on it.
      - I studied a SaaS survey report that provides some data on sales, marketing, 
        on subscription-based systems. Collected a set of questions that I'll ask
        with a marketing friend of mine.
      - I read the Apprenticeship Patterns for Aspiring Software Craftsmen book.
        Really excellent book which comprises a lot of the philosophies that I 
        myself have been practicing. Definitely should skim through and find any
        neat gems I ought to pick up.
      - Tomorrow, or when internet permits, I should check out Dave Hoover and
         Adewale Oshineye if they have any organizations they are currently 
         running that I can explore or connect with.

      - I finished reading quite a lot of books.
    doing_today: |
      - I explored more of my laptop's book collection to read more things 
        surrounding growth, learning, and apprenticeships.
      - I applied to PushFar.com, which is a free mentorship/apprenticeship 
        site.
      - I applied to be a mentor to two Filipinos adjacent to software engineering.
      - My goal is to mentor possibly 4 apprentices concurrently, and do my
        research with them.

      - Internet has still been intermittent. The good thing is I have a lot of
        books that I can read on my laptop and Kindle. I'm spending most of my time
        just absorbing what I can and applying it for Tome.gg. Other times, I just
        daydream and diagram things in my notes, for Tome.gg's documentation.

      - I had my Strategic Management of IP class today, and learned quite a lot
        about agri and food industry, along with pharma industry.
      - Big take-away lessons are: (1) build and serve the biggest market that you 
        can pursue then export your technology to your desired beneficiary (i.e. PH),
        (2) Leverage patent registries as knowledge repositories, and use it to 
        enter the market early. Later, when patents expire, you can leverage the
        technologies in the expired patents to cut costs.
      - I started drafting up more diagrams on my business plan for Tome.gg, including
        visualizations of how Tome.gg is attacking educational inaccessibility.
        Specifically, I added two new sheets to my Draw.io: Economic disruption
        of educational costs, and Mapping out timings.
      - Today I'm going to take a rest day, and spend the rest of the weekend
        afternoon resting.
      - When I do find a bit of inspiration, I'll focus on marketing strategy and
        planning -- specifically designing incentives for apprentices, and 
        collaborating with possible influencers.

      - Some internet connectivity returned, so I was able to look into a problem
        I had with my whitepaper which is to present images full width on my 
        two-column paper.
      - I spent most of the day resting, and did not spend too much time on the
        marketing strategy.
      - I also attended an ED3 DAO coffee chat and was able to network with Ernest
        from Gaia, along with the regular folks at ED3 DAO. Ernest and I were able 
        to chat about his current progress of work in Bankless DAO which I think is
        really cool. I feel like I'll be able to collaborate with him when it 
        comes to creating learning content.
    doing_today: |
      - As today is a Sunday, I'm going to be taking the time to rest and focus on
        other parts of my life, rather than think too much about Tome.gg.
      - Today's focus is to focus on rest, and cultivate a hunger for Monday's work.
      - Daydream and peg keywords for things to explore, but no heavy lifting.
      - I'll be tutoring a close friend when it comes to software security and
        engineering today. I will reflect on the experience of mentoring her today
        and probably write a short reflection about it on Sapalo.dev.
      - On Monday, I want to focus on writing base content on Tome.gg immediately, 
        referencing the mental models (or theories) that are already in my arsenal.
      - The goal will be to simply enumerate the "chapter headings" and not focus
        on the specific details, or the inner content.

      - The goal will be to simply enumerate at least 10 "chapter headings" and not focus
        on the specific details or the inner content.
      - We'll do a bit of ClickUp project management and tracking today to make
        sure our objectives are fresh and we're carefully optimizing for those goals.

    done_yesterday: |
      - I was able to discover some technology called Open Knowledge Map, which I then
        quickly researched, and deployed for myself.
      - It wasn't part of the plans yesterday, so I regard it as lost focus- but this
        has been one of the key visions that I had for Tome.gg way, way back.
      - I deployed a self-hosted instance and will later integrate it such that it loads
        data from the Tome.gg platform.
      - Later on, anybody can contribute to that data, and the Tome.gg platform can act
        as a curator/validator for high quality content.
      - Although I haven't done the 10 chapter headings that I said, I did read up on
        apprenticeship patterns which contained the mental models I do want to reference,
        and incorporated them into the presentation that I have for later.
      - To some extent, I did apply the mental models research, but it did not result
        into the expected output (chapter headings, initial writing plans) and instead
        was incorporated into the live presentation that I will have.
    doing_today: |
      - I find that I have been overly optimistic with how much time I have for the past
        few days and I feel like I need to readjust my estimation/plans.
      - Today I have a talk about open-source technologies and app modernization 
        hosted by Microsoft PH, so today will be a light work day.
      - I'm simplifying my task to just deciding on what are the top 5 mental 
        models to write about for someone who is starting on their journey to become
        a mid- or senior-level software engineer.
    remarks: 
      My internet has been stable for the past two days. I'm grateful.
