      The following notes were copied from my Bear note app (offline note taking)
      which I spoke about/planned while I was driving. This is why the date of 
      entry into the repository (March 22) doesn't match the datetime submitted.

      - we can skip all over the alignment negotiation protocol first and focus on
        the protocol design for storing the data for your daily standup report and
        your growth data.
      - Let's try to look at it from an evaluation first perspective. Evaluation 
        can be done at a per instance style, where in each day is evaluated each 
        day. The other option is evaluating a series of the data as a whole set 
        for example, evaluating five days altogether that flexibility should allow 
        us to analyze the data individually or in a aggregate. This makes it 
        flexible for people who don't want to analyze each data point. 
      - From a mentor's perspective this is convenient because that might be less 
        work for me and we're going to be able to look at or evaluate the different
        dimensions. For example- focus, consistency, clarity … across multiple data
        points so at least the student has some opportunity to practice the skill
        consistently over a period of time. Each evaluation can then demonstrate 
        whether they have been consistently able to perform based on those 
        aggregate evaluation. 
      - Now, let's analyze it from a solo player perspective when I don't have a
        mentor of my own- how do I keep myself accountable to myself into my 
        objectives? This means that I need to mentor myself, in which case I 
        specify very clearly my objectives and my goals, specify specific objectives,
        actionable things that can be measured and tracked and see whether or not 
        they do that.
      - From a solo player perspective… what is important to me for evaluation of 
        my growth at the end of my evaluation? I want to be able to see whether or
        not I have actually been practicing the skills (consistency, focus, clarity)
        and see whether I am progressing from my Likert scale of 1 to 5. 
      - This is going to demonstrate self evaluation, and I can double check with
        my mentors in DLSU, whether or not the efforts that I am doing does indeed
        contribute to what I am trying to accomplish. It is going to be attractive
        for mentors because they're going to be able to see an individual really 
        practicing consistency.
      - We're not going to be creating a view for the mentor specifically. For now
        we're just going to be leveraging markdown and Github. That's where they 
        can view my growth in my development.
      - A common pitfall is trying to aim for usability and correctness of the start.
        No, we are going to be focusing first on making things work, so we'll start 
        with some simple protocol definition and give it a version.

      I ought to be more careful about how I spend my time. I'm worried that I 
      might end up trying to do too many broad things that don't create value for
      Tome.gg.

      - I started with working on the Librarian protocol, such that I am now able
        to parse the YAML files.
      - I started work on the Librarian protocol's validation rules for the DSU
        validations.
      - I started on my automated-marketing tool. It leverages
        GitHub webhooks triggered by commits, n8n for automation, OpenAI for Tweet
        generation, and social integrations (Twitter, Discord) for distribution.
      - I also

      - I resumed my work on the validators, finished the DSU validator, and 
        started with the evaluator validator. This one will be responsible for
        validating the evaluations of a mentor/teacher/evaluator.
      - I reviewed why the automated-marketing tool wasn't posting Tweets. It had
        permission issues, so I configured it so that it will post on the Tome.gg
        Twitter account. I was able to verify that it works.
      - I also explored building a dynamically-generated daily progress banner for
        people learning in public. This automatically lifts data from your Tome.gg
        DSU repository, similar to this one.
      - I also built out a fish tool to easily add entries to the DSU.
      - I also built made pre-built binaries for the `tome` CLI, and an intake 
        page for alpha testers for Tome.gg, so that it will be easy to invite
        developers to try out the tooling.

      - I finished creating the librarian protocol, the librarian CLI, and a 
        sample repository (this one). 
      - I also finished creating an in-take form for interested apprentices who 
        wish to learn in public.
    doing_today: |
      - I'm going to be taking it easy today and focus on reading items. 
      - It will be a study day rather than a build day. 
      - I'll review my Click Up board for reading material, organize which 
        content should be prioritized. 
      - Today I will focus on resisting the urge to keep building, and stepping 
        back to see the bigger picture. 
      - I will have a more organized click up board and a clear picture of which
        tasks have more weight in bringing value to Tome.gg and its beneficiaries.

      - I'll be busy driving today, so work will be intermittent. 
      - As I will be out, I worry about my internet connectivity. If internet 
        fails, I'll focus on reading some books that I have on my kindle. I 
        should also set up reading materials (from ClickUp) into my kindle 
        in case this connectivity issue happens again.
    remarks: |
      - Interestingly, when a person does not have internet access, they can still
        write their DSU reports offline, timestamp the work, and push it out later.
      - Of course this can be forged (by changing local time on your host machine)
        but it has somewhat an interesting offline/async property in your daily
        reporting.
