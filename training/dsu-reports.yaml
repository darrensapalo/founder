    remarks: |
      I ought to be more careful about how I spend my time. I'm worried that I 
      might end up trying to do too many broad things that don't create value for
      Tome.gg.
    done_yesterday: |
      - I started with working on the Librarian protocol, such that I am now able
        to parse the YAML files.
      - I started work on the Librarian protocol's validation rules for the DSU
        validations.
      - I started on my automated-marketing tool. It leverages
        GitHub webhooks triggered by commits, n8n for automation, OpenAI for Tweet
        generation, and social integrations (Twitter, Discord) for distribution.

      - I resumed my work on the validators, finished the DSU validator, and 
        started with the evaluator validator. This one will be responsible for
        validating the evaluations of a mentor/teacher/evaluator.
      - I reviewed why the automated-marketing tool wasn't posting Tweets. It had
        permission issues, so I configured it so that it will post on the Tome.gg
        Twitter account. I was able to verify that it works.
      - I also explored building a dynamically-generated daily progress banner for
        people learning in public. This automatically lifts data from your Tome.gg
        DSU repository, similar to this one.
      - I also built out a fish tool to easily add entries to the DSU.
      - I also built made pre-built binaries for the `tome` CLI, and an intake 
        page for alpha testers for Tome.gg, so that it will be easy to invite
        developers to try out the tooling.
