      - As the MBA school year has concluded (with only summer term remaining), I 
        decided to focus my efforts in my job search here in San Francisco. I've 
        decided on a set of criteria for my job search and have collected potential
        job opportunities to pursue.
      - After meeting with Racquel, I was able to reflect on a couple of learnings
        when it comes to networking remotely. It's important to keep in mind people
        and what they work on, so that you can tell stories about people and what 
        they do.
    doing_today: |
      - Assess how many job applications I can feasibly do, so that I know the
        resource constraints of my search (i.e. how many jobs can I apply for?
        how many interviews can I do? When should I make a decision?)
      - Update at least one blog post from sapalo.dev (probably the RapidPass one)
      - Come up with a project plan for the job applications.

      - Yesterday (and the day prior), I focused on working on a pet project for
        TheGamingClassroom in building tooling that analyzes a DotA 2 player's
        combat performance. This needs to be deferred for later- not performed
        full time. I can probably explore this on weekends or something.
