      On Friday (October 3), I completed building my pull requests for new backend
      APIs. However, I identified a significant process issue: my pull requests
      have become too large, with some reaching 2,000-3,000 lines of code
      across 30-40+ files. This creates substantial review burden for colleagues
      due to high context switching costs. I've committed to breaking down my
      large pull request into six smaller, more manageable pull requests of
      300-500 lines each, touching only 3-4 files per PR to reduce cognitive
      load for reviewers.
    doing_today: |
      Today I successfully created two pull requests that are under 500 lines
      of code and touch fewer than four files each, actively demonstrating the
      smaller PR practice I committed to. This shows I'm effectively
      implementing careful code organization to ensure each PR maintains logical
      cohesion while significantly reducing the context switching burden for my
      teammates.
    blockers: |
      I have two pull requests currently awaiting colleague review, but this
      isn't blocking my progress on other work.

    done_yesterday: |
      Yesterday I focused on practicing creating smaller pull requests that
      make it easy for fellow engineers to review and provide feedback. This
      continues my commitment to breaking down large changes into manageable
      chunks that reduce cognitive load and context switching for reviewers.
    doing_today: |
      Today I continued practicing small pull request creation while exploring
      ways to accelerate my development velocity. I'm investigating strategies
      to move faster despite the PR review process, including familiarizing
      myself with different areas of the codebase to identify opportunities for
      parallel progress and skill development.
    blockers: |
      I feel blocked by the pace of my current learning processs (waiting for 
      external validation from the PR review process) which creates a
      sense of slowness in my overall development progress. This is motivating
      me to explore alternative learning paths and codebase areas where I can
      maintain momentum while waiting for reviews.

    done_yesterday: |
      Yesterday I continued practicing small PR development work, which gave me
      more confidence in my approach. In the evening, I went home and continued
      working, spending time understanding the codebase by exploring error
      repositories and identifying meaningful issues to investigate and fix.
      This independent problem identification and solving exercise significantly
      boosted my confidence. I also had a productive one-on-one conversation
      with my CTO Dan, where we discussed optimal roles for each team member
      and how everyone can contribute most effectively.
    doing_today: |
      Today I focused primarily on closing out multiple pull requests while
      maintaining the small PR constraint that reduces context switching burden
      for colleagues reviewing my work. I also actively reviewed other people's
      pull requests, which provided valuable context about what teammates are
      working on and helped me understand different approaches to similar
      problems. I have a clear end-of-week goal that I'm targeting to complete
      by tomorrow, which feels exciting and achievable.
    remarks: |
      A key reflection on my growth journey: surrounding yourself with
      trustworthy colleagues who take work seriously, maintain high standards,
      and demonstrate tenacity for excellence is an incredibly valuable
      advantage. This environment quality should be carefully evaluated and
      prioritized when choosing which teams, startups, or work environments to
      join. The caliber of people you work alongside significantly impacts your
      own growth trajectory and professional development.

      Yesterday was Friday. What I focused on was being able to do the end to
      end integration for one of the components that I was building. But
      surprisingly, I had some misunderstanding about the OAuth implementation
      and what functionally we needed to be able to integrate with the third
      party component that we were building. So that took me some time to
      experiment with and understand. And then at the end of the day, I was
      able to push out the pull request that was reviewed and merged so that we
      can store the access tokens generated and refresh tokens generated on our
      backend system. This will allow our systems to integrate with those third
      party software and I learned more about access tokens and refresh tokens
      throughout the process.
    doing_today: |
      Today I'm not doing anything because it's Saturday. I'm just reflecting
      on yesterday's daily standup report. I don't have any blockers and other
      things that I'm focusing on doing today is just doing some reflections
      about my personal and professional history and unwinding and resting.
