    done_yesterday: |
      On Friday (October 3), I completed building my pull requests for new backend
      APIs. However, I identified a significant process issue: my pull requests
      have become too large, with some reaching 2,000-3,000 lines of code
      across 30-40+ files. This creates substantial review burden for colleagues
      due to high context switching costs. I've committed to breaking down my
      large pull request into six smaller, more manageable pull requests of
      300-500 lines each, touching only 3-4 files per PR to reduce cognitive
      load for reviewers.
    doing_today: |
      Today I successfully created two pull requests that are under 500 lines
      of code and touch fewer than four files each, actively demonstrating the
      smaller PR practice I committed to. This shows I'm effectively
      implementing careful code organization to ensure each PR maintains logical
      cohesion while significantly reducing the context switching burden for my
      teammates.
    blockers: |
      I have two pull requests currently awaiting colleague review, but this
      isn't blocking my progress on other work.
