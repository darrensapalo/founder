      On Friday (October 3), I completed building my pull requests for new backend
      APIs. However, I identified a significant process issue: my pull requests
      have become too large, with some reaching 2,000-3,000 lines of code
      across 30-40+ files. This creates substantial review burden for colleagues
      due to high context switching costs. I've committed to breaking down my
      large pull request into six smaller, more manageable pull requests of
      300-500 lines each, touching only 3-4 files per PR to reduce cognitive
      load for reviewers.
    doing_today: |
      Today I successfully created two pull requests that are under 500 lines
      of code and touch fewer than four files each, actively demonstrating the
      smaller PR practice I committed to. This shows I'm effectively
      implementing careful code organization to ensure each PR maintains logical
      cohesion while significantly reducing the context switching burden for my
      teammates.
    blockers: |
      I have two pull requests currently awaiting colleague review, but this
      isn't blocking my progress on other work.

    done_yesterday: |
      Yesterday I focused on practicing creating smaller pull requests that
      make it easy for fellow engineers to review and provide feedback. This
      continues my commitment to breaking down large changes into manageable
      chunks that reduce cognitive load and context switching for reviewers.
    doing_today: |
      Today I continued practicing small pull request creation while exploring
      ways to accelerate my development velocity. I'm investigating strategies
      to move faster despite the PR review process, including familiarizing
      myself with different areas of the codebase to identify opportunities for
      parallel progress and skill development.
    blockers: |
      I feel blocked by the pace of my current learning processs (waiting for 
      external validation from the PR review process) which creates a
      sense of slowness in my overall development progress. This is motivating
      me to explore alternative learning paths and codebase areas where I can
      maintain momentum while waiting for reviews.

    done_yesterday: |
      Yesterday I continued practicing small PR development work, which gave me
      more confidence in my approach. In the evening, I went home and continued
      working, spending time understanding the codebase by exploring error
      repositories and identifying meaningful issues to investigate and fix.
      This independent problem identification and solving exercise significantly
      boosted my confidence. I also had a productive one-on-one conversation
      with my CTO Dan, where we discussed optimal roles for each team member
      and how everyone can contribute most effectively.
    doing_today: |
      Today I focused primarily on closing out multiple pull requests while
      maintaining the small PR constraint that reduces context switching burden
      for colleagues reviewing my work. I also actively reviewed other people's
      pull requests, which provided valuable context about what teammates are
      working on and helped me understand different approaches to similar
      problems. I have a clear end-of-week goal that I'm targeting to complete
      by tomorrow, which feels exciting and achievable.
    remarks: |
      A key reflection on my growth journey: surrounding yourself with
      trustworthy colleagues who take work seriously, maintain high standards,
      and demonstrate tenacity for excellence is an incredibly valuable
      advantage. This environment quality should be carefully evaluated and
      prioritized when choosing which teams, startups, or work environments to
      join. The caliber of people you work alongside significantly impacts your
      own growth trajectory and professional development.

      Yesterday was Friday. What I focused on was being able to do the end to
      end integration for one of the components that I was building. But
      surprisingly, I had some misunderstanding about the OAuth implementation
      and what functionally we needed to be able to integrate with the third
      party component that we were building. So that took me some time to
      experiment with and understand. And then at the end of the day, I was
      able to push out the pull request that was reviewed and merged so that we
      can store the access tokens generated and refresh tokens generated on our
      backend system. This will allow our systems to integrate with those third
      party software and I learned more about access tokens and refresh tokens
      throughout the process.
    doing_today: |
      Today I'm not doing anything because it's Saturday. I'm just reflecting
      on yesterday's daily standup report. I don't have any blockers and other
      things that I'm focusing on doing today is just doing some reflections
      about my personal and professional history and unwinding and resting.

      Just general reflections about my progress for the past week, and how I
      could have improved. Parts of it was balancing my growth in terms of the
      work output I needed to deliver (new features, components, APIs) as well
      as learning the overall system (Sentry exception debugging, data model
      studying etc).
    doing_today: |
      Today is to prioritize rest, weekly resets, spend time with friends. Good
      downtime spent. In terms of reflecting on the week ahead, my goal is to
      deliver the book a call component by the end of the week (and onboarding
      integration) and get finish my work on investigating some stable account
      issues.
    blockers: |
      No- I just need to spend my time learning and documenting my processes.
      That will accelerate my learning.
    remarks: |
      I bought a guitar, which is great. This is an awesome creative outlet for
      me.

      Yesterday, Sunday, I basically rested and spent my downtime.
    doing_today: |
      Today, Monday, I spent planning out my end-of-week objectives and what I
      wanted to accomplish. I wanted to make sure that I closed off this feature
      I was building, which cut through the whole application. It involved the
      back end and the front end and involved two separate UI components that I
      was building. I decided for myself on Monday morning to make sure that I
      meet a goal for the end-of-Monday and the end-of-Tuesday. At the end of
      Monday, I did not get to completely merge in the pull request that I
      wanted, but I did get my first round of reviews through collaboration with
      my team. And that made me feel good. I didn't have any blockers and I was
      able to move forward.

    done_yesterday: |
      Yesterday, Monday, I ran through the first round of revisions for the
      first of two components that I was building at work. I was able to get
      that mostly across and I had some minor revisions that I needed to work on
      today, which I was able to do.
    doing_today: |
      My goal today is to be able to close off that one of two onboarding
      components that I was building and get started with integration for the
      second UI component that I'm building. My end goal today is basically get
      these implementations done up to the level of integration and get it to
      the point where it's ready for review with my colleagues. Thankfully, it's
      at the end of the day now and I was able to complete the integration
      implementation for the second component and it's now ready for review or
      at least the first pass review with my colleagues. The next thing that I'm
      planning to do is write out a one pager for the next set of work I'm targeting
      to accomplish. This will force me to carefully articulate my objectives given
      a specific timeline.
    remarks: |
      I have been continuously practicing my small pull requests. Some feedback
      that I've received recently in my pull requests is to err on the side of
      leveraging existing libraries in npm rather than rebuilding things from
      scratch. I shouldn't be over optimizing in terms of keeping things simple
      and just having a simple function because I don't want to import too much
      from third party services or packages. Because third party packages can
      be gzipped and made smaller and that wouldn't be too much of a problem. So
      I'm taking that feedback in and I'm reflecting on it. I should optimize
      more for correctness, completeness and maintainability rather than package
      weight or package lightness or not having too many dependencies.
