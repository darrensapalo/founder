       Three key aspects to focus on which are (a) experience and durability 
       in building applications that rapidly scale; (b) writing your own seminal
       work; (c) an iterative and measured approach to experimentation

    remarks: |
      - Project 2 involves demonstrating my experience with service oriented
        architecture, containerization, familarity with AWS, and CI/CD on 
        GitHub actions. Although I wasn't part of the devops team before, 
        I have learned these tools as I needed them for Tome.gg.
      - Project 3 involves demonstrating my understanding of feature flags and
        experimentation, as well as my technical experience with Google Analytics.
        With this, I'll showcase my experience with what I learned from my 
        Operations Analytics class from Hult, as well as data analysis on the
        synthetic data that could possibly be collected from the HFI system.

      - Spoke with a friend who advised me on what to focus on for the kinds of
        people they pick up and attract at Anthropic.
      - 95% finished with the UI design revisions I wanted.
      - Focused on implementing the core logic of the submitting the instance 
        evaluations by annotators.
      - Configured, keyboard shortcuts annotation experience a lot smoother.
      - Finished login and log out features.
      - Remaining work for Project 1 (HFI, React) is Authentication Guard 
        and some minor component unit-testing. 
      - Today, I'm targeting to complete Project 1, as well as write a blog 
        post about my experience.
