      Last week (Friday), I was preparing for my work at Layer where I am currently tasked to build some new features. 
      I had some good progress already and have some PRs pending for review, so I began to shape up the work for 
      the next feature that I was building.
    doing_today: |
      Today, I doubled down on the component that I was working on last week. I received the updated Figma Designs 
      which I then executed reaching to the point of getting a component to be responsive, mobile responsive. 
      The tricky part of what I need to do on the front end is that I'm not simply building a website, 
      I am building a component library or a component within a component library that many developers will be 
      using, so accessibility and other aspects of frontend development are importantâ€”areas that I'm not as familiar with yet.

      Yesterday (Monday), I updated my website for Tome.gg, as well as simplified the documentation on how to start 
      your growth journal.
    doing_today: |
      Today I'll be working on Layer components that will be focused on our component library. I'll also practice a 
      bit more fundamentals in financial accounting as well as study the team's ledger system.
    blockers: |
      None.
    remarks: |
      I stayed up late on Monday (unnecessarily) because I was enjoying building for Tome.gg. Not good practice, I know
      I'm supposed to be prioritizing sleep. I think this was partly due to taking caffeine late in the evening (Coke).

    remarks: |
      Learning to work backwards from requirements rather than over-engineering
      solutions upfront. Recognizing the importance of considering developer
      experience and usability when building components. Growing awareness that
      taking more time upfront to think through design decisions can reduce
      revision cycles and improve code quality. Developing better collaboration
      skills by actively seeking feedback and incorporating it constructively.
    done_yesterday: |
      Spent time researching and planning before diving into implementation,
      showing improved project scoping skills. Actively sought and incorporated
      feedback from team members on technical design approaches. Focused on
      understanding system architecture at a deeper level rather than just
      surface-level implementation.
    doing_today: |
      Applying feedback from code reviews and iterating on solutions based on
      peer input. Taking time to study underlying system architecture to build
      stronger foundational understanding. Preparing for technical discussions
      by researching relevant topics beforehand.
    blockers: |
      Waiting for guidance and direction from senior team members. Dependency
      on others for code review completion before moving forward.
