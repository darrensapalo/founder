      Last week (Friday), I was preparing for my work at Layer where I am currently tasked to build some new features. 
      I had some good progress already and have some PRs pending for review, so I began to shape up the work for 
      the next feature that I was building.
    doing_today: |
      Today, I doubled down on the component that I was working on last week. I received the updated Figma Designs 
      which I then executed reaching to the point of getting a component to be responsive, mobile responsive. 
      The tricky part of what I need to do on the front end is that I'm not simply building a website, 
      I am building a component library or a component within a component library that many developers will be 
      using, so accessibility and other aspects of frontend development are importantâ€”areas that I'm not as familiar with yet.

      Yesterday (Monday), I updated my website for Tome.gg, as well as simplified the documentation on how to start 
      your growth journal.
    doing_today: |
      Today I'll be working on Layer components that will be focused on our component library. I'll also practice a 
      bit more fundamentals in financial accounting as well as study the team's ledger system.
    blockers: |
      None.
    notes: |
      I stayed up late on Monday (unnecessarily) because I was enjoying building for Tome.gg. Not good practice, I know
      I'm supposed to be prioritizing sleep. I think this was partly due to taking caffeine late in the evening (Coke).
