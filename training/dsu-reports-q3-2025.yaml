      Yesterday I was preparing for my work at Lair where I was building for a couple of new features. But because I was blocked on some PRs for review, I began shaping up the work for the next feature that I was building.
    doing_today: |
      Today I doubled down on the component that I was working on last week, last Friday, and I received the updated Figma Designs which I then executed reaching to the point of getting a component to be responsive, mobile responsive. The tricky part in what I need to do on the front end is that I'm not simply building a website, I am building a component library or a component within a component library that many developers will be using so accessibility and other aspects of frontend development are important that I'm not so used to yet.
