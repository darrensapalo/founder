        remarks: >
          At this point I knew that I am supposed to be practicing focus, but I
          had urges to tinker with OpenAI and ChatGPT because everyone's working 
          with it. Out of some fears, I was worried that if I don't tinker with it,
          I'll get left behind. I recognize this is a fear-based approach though.
