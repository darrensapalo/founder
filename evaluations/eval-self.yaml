          Taking part in a hackathon, where there will be judges that specify exactly
          what their criteria is when evaluating you, truly helped me focus more.
          The deadlines were clear, the expectations were clear. It was a nice
          activity to participate in.

          These were notes that I was writing down, and thinking about while I 
          was driving. I was literally practicing focus at this moment, and I was
          consciously trimming out things that I won't do, so that I don't waste 
          time. I'm very proud of this time because doing this practice while
          I was driving felt very efficient.

          At this point I knew that I am supposed to be practicing focus, but I
          had urges to tinker with OpenAI and ChatGPT because everyone's working 
          with it. Out of some fears, I was worried that if I don't tinker with it,
          I'll get left behind. I recognize this is a fear-based approach though.

          I didn't particularly let myself get distracted today by wanting to do
          other things (build, experiment on things). It was a consciously decided
          day that I knew was going to be 'light' in my practice of focus since I
          had activities to attend to. Despite that, I was able to focus on it a 
          little bit with reflections on marketing, but less strategy and planning.

          Despite not having internet access, I was able to focus my efforts more
          on the things that I do have control of and what I have access to. I read
          a couple of books that are related to my business, and wrote down notes
          on how I can leverage the concepts around them. Definitely a good practice.

          Not entirely a planned thing, but more of a reactive thing. I decided to
          apply to PushFar as a mentor, but this hasn't been something that I 
          actively planned for. I'm rating myself with a score of 2 because I could
          have better planned out my marketing direction and strategies better.

          business owner and mentor.

          I've been having a good balance of focusing on the people aspects of 
          the business (talking to internal teammates and external partners). I'm 
          also able to properly manage time allocations for each, and am responsibly
          setting clear expectations with the people I work with. This allows me to
          work more effectively with them, and also identify which teammates or
          suppliers I can and cannot work with.

          Absorbing the large amount of new information at my recently joined
          company presents significant focus challenges. I've mitigated this by
          writing down questions, sorting them by priority based on my
          understanding, and asking targeted questions that provide context for
          better prioritization. This approach minimizes the demands I place on
          peers and colleagues. The activities requiring the most sustained focus
          involved shaping up engineering work when taking ownership of completely
          new features, particularly systems design work. To handle competing
          priorities and maintain focus, I organize my thoughts and plans into
          Linear tickets, allowing me to juggle tasks more effectively.

          I maintained good separation between work and personal projects during
          this period. After finishing work early, I had quality space to rest and
          review my Tome.gg work, which I had not revisited for around 2 years.
          My focus was strong in maintaining clear boundaries—doing work during
          work hours and side projects after work hours. However, I unnecessarily
          stayed up late, which compromised my sleep discipline and prevents a
          perfect focus score.

        remarks: |
          Maintaining focus was challenging due to the variety of different things
          to work on and study at Layer. Shaping up work consistently requires the
          most focus as it involves directions and strategy decisions. I handle
          competing priorities by writing down my plans extensively. However, my
          focus discipline was compromised when I asked Andrew for more work
          despite already having a clear set of other tasks to complete, such as
          shaping up segmented financial analysis. This showed poor prioritization
          and focus on existing commitments.

          I was quite focused on ensuring I don't create large pull requests that
          are difficult for peers to review. What I thought would be more
          difficult was actually straightforward when I started deciding how to
          split the large pull request into smaller pieces. This demonstrates
          strong sustained attention on the improvement objective without
          distraction.

          Breaking down the PRs was much simpler and easier to make progress on.
          The PRs I created were primarily about writing React hooks that
          interacted with backend APIs while enforcing schemas, following good
          practices already enforced in the frontend application. This approach
          maintained logical simplicity and elegance.

        remarks: |
          I intentionally didn't overthink the implementation and instead
          leveraged existing patterns in the frontend application. I used the
          standard StaleWhileRevalidate React framework for querying and
          leveraged the pagination mechanism that the backend API already had.
          Kept it simple by following best practices of the existing codebase,
          demonstrating deliberate and well-reasoned technical decisions.

          I completed two pull requests today: one investigating backend
          performance measurements for upload issues, and another for frontend
          types, schemas, and API integration. While productive, I feel this
          could be faster with more AI harnesses, which I'm investing time in
          building so future development can be significantly faster.

          I definitely practiced this skill today by creating two small PRs under

          of breaking down large pull requests into smaller, more manageable
          chunks that reduce cognitive load for reviewers.

          I was extremely focused. Something that did help me grind out a lot
          more work was having a cappuccino in the afternoon. Honestly, I feel
          like the cappuccino would have done better work if I had drunk it
          earlier in the day. And I would probably not screwed up my sleep if I
          had the coffee earlier rather than in the afternoon. I maintained
          focus during the PR review activities by just really being focused on
          the outcome that I want, which is a fast turnaround PR review from my
          colleagues. The clear end of week goal helped me focus on which PRs I
          needed to get across the finish line. It helped me distinguish which
          things were high priority versus low priority, nice to have versus
          necessary. The work that I did in the evening wasn't related to the
          end of week goals that I had, but simply my 30 day goals of being
          able to do some sentry or error investigations and fixes.

          This was me committing to practicing, beginning to commit to practice
          smaller pull requests, which I feel like I definitely locked in and
          practiced because I wanted to get that practice and the best practice
          and habit locked in very quickly. The challenging part is as a
          software engineer, I want to see my results come in end-to-end and I
          try that. I touch a lot of different things when I build a complete
          feature end-to-end and the PR process makes me feel like I'm slowing
          down, but it's about jogging at the pace of everybody in the team so
          that I can absorb and learn from the best practices that they already
          have. If learning wasn't important to me, then I wouldn't care, but
          because I want to learn and I want to grow and absorb practices that
          my fellow colleagues already do, this is the thing that I need to do.
          I need to slow down. I need to make my changes more focused and
          receive feedback and regularly practice them. This is justifying why I
          need to slow down and experience this feeling of being blocked. This
          is normal. This is fine. We just need to be patient as we grind
          along.

          I did prioritize just resting and downtime and reflecting on maybe
          getting a guitar as a way to kind of have some rest and creative outlet
          outside of crafting software. So I would probably say that I focused on
          my rest appropriately.
