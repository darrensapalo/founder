          Taking part in a hackathon, where there will be judges that specify exactly
          what their criteria is when evaluating you, truly helped me focus more.
          The deadlines were clear, the expectations were clear. It was a nice
          activity to participate in.

          These were notes that I was writing down, and thinking about while I 
          was driving. I was literally practicing focus at this moment, and I was
          consciously trimming out things that I won't do, so that I don't waste 
          time. I'm very proud of this time because doing this practice while
          I was driving felt very efficient.

          At this point I knew that I am supposed to be practicing focus, but I
          had urges to tinker with OpenAI and ChatGPT because everyone's working 
          with it. Out of some fears, I was worried that if I don't tinker with it,
          I'll get left behind. I recognize this is a fear-based approach though.

          I didn't particularly let myself get distracted today by wanting to do
          other things (build, experiment on things). It was a consciously decided
          day that I knew was going to be 'light' in my practice of focus since I
          had activities to attend to. Despite that, I was able to focus on it a 
          little bit with reflections on marketing, but less strategy and planning.

          Despite not having internet access, I was able to focus my efforts more
          on the things that I do have control of and what I have access to. I read
          a couple of books that are related to my business, and wrote down notes
          on how I can leverage the concepts around them. Definitely a good practice.

          Not entirely a planned thing, but more of a reactive thing. I decided to
          apply to PushFar as a mentor, but this hasn't been something that I 
          actively planned for. I'm rating myself with a score of 2 because I could
          have better planned out my marketing direction and strategies better.

          As I was listening to my IP class, thoughts of how I can contextualize 
          the IP management strategies for Tome.gg pops out, and I write them down.
          Good practice overall.

          This time could have been used elsewhere. However, writing the blog post
          on ChatGPT does lead to Tome.gg. However, it could have been time spent 
          elsewhere.

          Although I produced a video asset (Appsmith 101) with low effort but 
          high value, I should be more wary about what events, speaking gigs I
          take up by qualifying how broad their audience reach is. That way I can
          say no to unproductive activities that don't meet my metrics.
